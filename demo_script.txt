Demo Video Script (1-2 minutes)
-------------------------------
Intro (10s):
Hello, I'm [Your Name]. Today I'll demo Agentic AI for Farmers — a privacy-first, decentralized AI assistant.

Problem (10s):
Farmers face uncertainty in crop choice due to soil, weather and market fluctuations.

Solution (20s):
Our agent runs locally on the farmer's device, gives crop recommendations, and collaborates via federated learning without sharing raw data.

Demo (40s):
1. Load sample input from the sidebar.
2. Click 'Get recommendation' — the agent evaluates and shows crop recommendation distribution.
3. View the grid of crop images (English/Hindi/Telugu labels) to help farmers decide.
4. Optional: Upload a short audio file; the app transcribes it (sidebar) for accessibility.

Closing (10s):
This demo shows privacy, accessibility, and decentralization working together. Thank you.
